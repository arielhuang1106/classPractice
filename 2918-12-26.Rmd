This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plasticContainer <- list(
  greenBox=c("paper","scissor"),     # location 1
  redBox=c(1L,3L,2.5),               # location 2
  blueBox=c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)    # location 3
)
```
##取出green box
```{r}
plasticContainer[c("greenBox")]
```

##承上 如果上面要取出paper，請問要怎麼延伸拿取？
```{r}
plasticContainer$greenBox[[1]]#or
plasticContainer$greenBox[1]
```

##合併前兩行
```{r}
plasticContainer[["greenBox"]][1]
```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
